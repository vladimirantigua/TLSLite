# TLSLite
TLSLite - developed a simplified version of the **Transport Layer Security** (TLS) protocol in **Java**. The TLSLite can be used to build a simple file transfer application.  
**Note:** the TLSLite does not include a lot of the features from the real TLS protocol and simplify the message format.
